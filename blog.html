                <h3>Otaku Oasis: Your Ultimate Guide to Anime and Manga</h3>
                <p>“Astro Boy” Pioneered Anime: Osamu Tezuka’s “Astro Boy” (Tetsuwan Atom) is often considered the first modern anime. It debuted in 1963 and set many of the conventions used in anime today.</p>
                <p>Longest Running Anime: “Sazae-san” holds the record for the longest-running anime series. It started in 1969 and has over 7,000 episodes.</p>
                <p>Unique Animation Styles: Many anime studios have distinctive animation styles. For example, Studio Ghibli’s films often feature detailed backgrounds and fluid animation, while “Attack on Titan” is known for its intense, fast-paced action sequences.</p>
                <p>Anime and Manga Influence: Manga (Japanese comics) often precedes anime adaptations. For instance, “One Piece” manga, created by Eiichiro Oda, began serialization in 1997, and its anime adaptation followed in 1999.</p>
                <p>Influence of Western Culture: Anime is influenced by various aspects of Western culture. For instance, “Cowboy Bebop” incorporates elements of American film noir and jazz music, while “Space Dandy” pays homage to 1960s American sci-fi TV shows.</p>
                <p>Voice Acting Traditions: Many anime voice actors (seiyuu) are celebrities in Japan and may perform live-action roles, sing, and even host television shows. For instance, Maaya Sakamoto, known for roles in “Escaflowne” and “Fate/stay night,” is also a successful singer.</p>
                <p>Cultural References: Anime often includes cultural references that may be obscure to international viewers. For example, “Naruto” features a variety of Japanese folklore creatures and traditional beliefs.</p>
                <p>Unique Episode Formats: Some anime series experiment with episode formats. “Kino’s Journey” features episodic storytelling where each episode is a self-contained story exploring different philosophical themes.</p>
                <p>Anime and Technology: The anime industry uses cutting-edge technology to create stunning visuals. For example, “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” employed advanced CGI techniques to create its highly detailed and fluid action sequences.</p>
                <p>Unusual Anime Genres: Anime covers a wide range of genres, including some very niche ones. For example, “Is the Order a Rabbit?” falls under the “moe” genre, focusing on cute characters and lighthearted scenarios.</p>
                <p>Famous Anime Directors: Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, has created many beloved films such as “Spirited Away,” which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003.</p>
